# Table 1 – Studies on AI Detection and ESL Writers

| Study / Report                                                            | Key Findings on ESL / L2 Writers                                                                 | False‑Positive Rate / Metric                                    |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Center for Democracy & Technology brief (based on Stanford study) – “Disproportionate Effects of Generative AI Detectors on English Learners” | AI detectors that work perfectly on native‑speaker essays falsely flagged a majority of ESL essays | **61 %** of non‑native essays flagged; **19 %** unanimously flagged; **97 %** flagged by at least one detector |
| *The Markup* (Mathewson, 2023)                                            | Replicated Stanford study; ESL writers disproportionately likely to be flagged                     | Same figures (~60 % false positives)                           |
| Turnitin blog (internal research)                                         | Acknowledges bias toward ELL writers; < 1 % overall false positives when ≥ 20 % of text is AI, but higher incidence with low‑AI content, especially for ESL writers | No precise overall % for ESL, but bias confirmed               |
