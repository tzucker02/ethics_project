## Appendix IV – Timeline

| Phase | Duration | Core Goal | Key Milestones & Deliverables | Owner(s) | Success Metric |
|-------|----------|-----------|------------------------------|----------|----------------|
| **0 – Initiation & Governance** | **2 weeks** | Secure sponsorship, define scope, assemble steering team. | • Charter & project charter signed<br>• Steering committee roster (Provost, Legal, IT, Faculty‑Senate rep, Student‑advocate)<br>• Project‑management workspace | Provost / Academic Integrity Office | Charter approved within 10 days; all roles confirmed. |
| **1 – Discovery & Requirements** | **4 weeks** | Gather evidence, map current workflows, capture stakeholder needs. | • Conduct 3 focus‑groups (ELL students, faculty, admin).<br>• Survey ≥ 70 % of instructors on current detector use.<br>• Compile “Current State” process map (detector → decision).<br>• Draft “Requirements Document” (legal, technical, pedagogical). | Lead: Faculty Senate Chair; Support: Compliance & IT | ≥ 80 % survey response; requirements sign‑off by Legal. |
| **2 – Policy Draft & Legal Review** | **3 weeks** | Write policy language, embed bias‑mitigation clauses, obtain legal clearance. | • First‑draft policy circulated to steering committee.<br>• Legal review memo (Title IV, AI‑Bill of Rights compliance).<br>• Incorporate feedback → “Final Draft”. | Policy Lead (Academic Integrity Office) + Legal Counsel | Legal sign‑off within 5 days of receipt. |
| **3 – Technical Pilot (Semester 1)** | **6 weeks** | Test detector + human‑review workflow in a limited setting. | • Select 2‑3 courses (high ELL enrollment).<br>• Deploy chosen detector (e.g., Pangram Labs) with API integration.<br>• Train 2‑3 faculty champions on review protocol.<br>• Collect quantitative data: false‑positive rate, review time, student satisfaction.<br>• Mid‑pilot check‑in meeting. | IT Services (integration) + Faculty Pilot Leads | ≤ 10 % false‑positive rate after human review; ≥ 75 % faculty satisfaction. |
| **4 – Evaluation & Iteration** | **2 weeks** (post‑pilot) | Analyse pilot data, refine policy & tech stack. | • Produce “Pilot Evaluation Report” (metrics, lessons learned).<br>• Update policy language (add clarifications).<br>• Decide on detector vendor (cost‑benefit). | Steering Committee (incl. Data Analyst) | Recommendation approved by majority vote; revised policy ready for full roll‑out. |
| **5 – Full‑Scale Roll‑out (Semester 2)** | **8 weeks** | Institution‑wide adoption, training, and support. | • Publish final policy on university website & LMS.<br>• Mandatory 1‑hour online training for all instructors (recorded webinar + quiz).<br>• Create “Help Desk” ticket queue for detector issues.<br>• Deploy detector across all courses (auto‑enabled but with opt‑out for exempted classes).<br>• Release “Student Guide” explaining rights, appeals, and error‑rate transparency. | Academic Tech Team + Communications Office | 100 % of instructors complete training; detector active in ≥ 95 % of courses. |
| **6 – Monitoring & Continuous Improvement** | **Ongoing (quarterly)** | Track compliance, refine processes, and report to governance. | • Quarterly KPI dashboard (false‑positive %, appeal volume, turnaround time).<br>• Annual stakeholder survey (students & faculty).<br>• Update policy/tech as needed (e.g., new detector releases). | Monitoring Sub‑Committee (Legal, IT, Faculty, Student Rep) | KPI trends moving toward ≤ 5 % false‑positive rate; ≤ 10 % appeal rate. |
| **7 – Formal Close‑out** | **2 weeks (end of academic year)** | Archive documentation, hand‑off to permanent governance. | • Final “Project Close‑out Report” (budget, outcomes, lessons).<br>• Archive all artifacts in the Institutional Repository.<br>• Transition ongoing monitoring to the Academic Integrity Office. | Project Manager + Academic Integrity Office | Report signed off; repository entry complete. |
