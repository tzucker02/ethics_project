### Week 8 Tasks
Building a Policy Analysis - Week 8 Tasks
For this week, you should research all of the currently proposed solutions.
Examples: after the release of ChatGPT, several universities, companies, and governments created documents on how they would handle generative AI within their organizations. These solutions can serve as examples of what people are already thinking about on your given topic. It would be even better if you found proposed solutions in your home country or state. Remember that these proposals likely use special terminology to talk about the problem, which, if you research those, will help you to find other resources.

Once you have gathered these proposals, describe and evaluate each one. Consider these questions:

What are the strengths and weaknesses of each proposal?
Are there elements of these proposals that you might add, remove, or potentially combine?
You can use these proposals as a baseline for your final policy advocacy. You do not need to adopt anything from other policies, but your paper will be more persuasive if you analyze them.

As you prepare to submit your final policy analysis, you may review the rubric and checklist below to familiarize yourself with the assignment requirements. Please read through both documents carefully, and bring any questions you have to the teaching team. More information will be provided in Week 11.

Building a Policy Analysis - Week 9 Tasks
Last week you identified policy examples from various contexts. Now reflect on the level of these policies and answer the following questions:

Are these policies proposed at a national, state/provincial, local, or business/organizational level?

For your policy:

What type of policy would be most effective in addressing your identified problem?
Would multiple levels of policy be needed? (e.g., a national‑level policy alongside a regulatory body to enforce it)
Would you advise companies to adopt a particular policy?
Additionally, consider where your policy will be implemented and what is needed to make it effective:

For government‑based policies, think about how the government will best deploy resources and monitor their efforts.
For business or university‑based policies, consider organizational structures and leadership roles.
Finally, reflect on the time and effort required for implementation. Remember, the leadership structure of an organization or government affects how quickly a policy can be enacted.

Building a Policy Analysis - Week 11 Tasks
A key part of your proposal is addressing potential critiques of your policy. Since you have examined other policies in your impact area, you may already be aware of some critiques that could also apply to yours. This week, consider the following questions:

Identify the critiques
a. What are the most significant critiques of your proposed policy?

Evaluate their relevance
a. Which critiques are most relevant to the implementation of your policy?

Develop your rebuttal
a. How can you respond to these critiques? How does your policy anticipate and address them?

Remember, ethics involve the process of persuasion. Addressing potential criticisms makes your policy more persuasive. Be thoughtful and thorough in considering how to strengthen your proposal by responding to potential challenges.

In your analysis, focus on the critiques you believe are most significant. Consider, for example, that a policy addressed by companies might face some initial resistance from them. What arguments can you use to overcome the objections that companies might have to your policy?

Presentation Instructions — 5‑10 slides, 3 minutes
Your presentation should have 5‑10 slides with a total duration of 3 minutes. You can refer to the presentation checklist for guidance on the presentation content and delivery.

Policy Analysis Paper instructions — 8‑10 pages in PDF
Your paper should be uploaded as a PDF document of 8‑10 pages. Title pages, citations, and appendices do not count towards this page limit. However, any main‑body content that goes past this limit will not be graded. Please include the links to your full conversations with the AI tools used (if any) in the appendix.

Building a Policy Analysis - Week 12 Tasks
Include citations from at least 12 relevant and credible sources.
Format these citations in APA style and include a bibliography.
Your bibliography should ideally list all resources you consulted, even if they were not explicitly cited in your paper.
Revise for clarity and persuasion
Review the structure of your paper to ensure it is logical and compelling for a reader with little prior knowledge of the topic. Ask yourself:

Does the order of sections flow smoothly?
How can I best present my argument to convince the reader that this policy is worthwhile?
Address key elements
Make sure your paper includes the folowing:

A clear identification of the ethical problem and the stakeholders involved.
An explanation of the ethical principles that are relevant to the isue.
A strong advocacy for one or more policies to address the problem.
A specification of the level at which the policy would be implemented (e.g., international organizations, national governments, professional associations, or corporate watchdogs).
A thoughtful anticipation of potential critiques of your policy, as well as consideration of any unintended negative consequences it might create.
Remember, revising your paper is not just about polishing the text—it's about refining your argument to ensure it is clear, persuasive, and well‑supported by evidence. Take the time to make your case compelling and grounded in ethical reasoning.
DISCORD Commentary
Applying the ethical framework to the problem
Look at the ethical framework; take those principles and apply them to the problem at hand.
Connect the problem to ethical principles that were discussed in the Tavani textbook and lecture.
Include why you chose that framework.
Policy advocacy and feasibility section
Show that the problem is very serious (one way to do it is through news).
Show the current policy has shortcomings—some bugs; your policy can remedy these bugs/shortages.
Show what each stakeholder gets as a benefit as a result of the policy (connect this to the stakeholder section of the paper—you don’t need the how/why, just what they get).
How the ethical framework supports your policy
(Insert your analysis here.)

Compare your policy with other policies
State what the existing policy attempts to do.
Explain why it doesn’t go far enough.
Point to specific differences between your policy and the policy that already exists.
Explain why your policy is better suited to solve the problem.
Stakeholder section
What tangible way was the stakeholder affected?

Why does being affected in this way matter to the stakeholder?

What would benefit the stakeholder?

So what happened is mitigated.
So what happened doesn’t happen again?
The implementation of the policy
Show where/which level the policy is implemented and what is needed.
Time and effort for policy – base the estimate on similar existing policies.
Barriers/challenges for implementing the policy – again, draw from comparable policies.
