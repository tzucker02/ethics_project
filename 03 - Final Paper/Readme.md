## Week 8 Tasks

### Building a Policy Analysis

**Goal:** Research *all* currently proposed solutions to your problem (e.g., university, corporate, or governmental AI‑policy documents).  

- Locate proposals from your home country/state if possible.  
- Pay attention to the specialized terminology they use; it will help you discover additional resources.

**After gathering proposals:**

1. **Describe** each one.  
2. **Evaluate** its strengths and weaknesses.  
3. Consider whether you would **add, remove, or combine** any elements.

You may use these proposals as a baseline for your final policy advocacy. You don’t have to adopt any of them, but analyzing them will make your paper more persuasive.

> **Tip:** Review the rubric and checklist before you begin; bring any questions to the teaching team. More details will be provided in Week 11.

## Week 9 Tasks

### Building a Policy Analysis

Reflect on the **level** of the policies you collected and answer:

1. Are the policies **national**, **state/provincial**, **local**, or **business/organizational**?  
2. For *your* policy:  
   - What type of policy would be most effective?  
   - Would you need **multiple levels** (e.g., a national law plus a regulatory body)?  
   - Should companies be advised to adopt a specific policy?  

**Implementation considerations**

- **Government‑based policies:** How will resources be deployed and monitored?  
- **Business/University policies:** What organizational structures and leadership roles are required?  

Think about the **time and effort** needed for implementation; leadership structure influences how quickly a policy can be enacted.

### Evaluate their relevance

## Week 12 Tasks

### Building a Policy Analysis

1. **Citations**  
   - Minimum **12** credible sources.  
   - Use **APA** style; list a bibliography.  
   - Bibliography should contain *all* consulted works, even if not directly cited.

2. **Revise for clarity & persuasion**  
   - Ensure logical flow.  
   - Ask:  
     - Does the order of sections flow smoothly? (`#section-order`)  
     - How can I best present my argument to convince the reader? (`#present-argument`)

3. **Address key elements** (`#address-key-elements`)  

   - **Ethical problem & stakeholders** (`#ethical-problem`)  
   - **Relevant ethical principles** (`#ethical-principles`)  
   - **Strong advocacy for policy(ies)** (`#policy-advocacy`)  
   - **Implementation level** (`#implementation-level`) – e.g., international org, national govt, professional assoc., corporate watchdog.  
   - **Anticipate critiques & unintended effects** (`#anticipate-critiques`)  

*Revision isn’t just polishing language; it’s sharpening the argument so it’s clear, persuasive, and evidence‑backed.*
