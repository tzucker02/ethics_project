If there is a free trial, how long does it last?

Accuracy – What is the reported accuracy of the detector (both from the company and third‑party evaluations)?

Does the accuracy hold up for ELL‑written work?
What’s Included –

Does it include a plagiarism checker? If so, is there an extra charge?
Does the tool also provide an AI “humanizer”?
