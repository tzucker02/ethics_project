# Appendix I - AI Usage

*(NOTE: portions of this appendix have been taken from the previous submission)*

1. **Grammarly** (<https://app.grammarly.com/>)
   - Throughout the paper, both the spelling and grammar were checked using Grammarly.  
   - There were no "exchanges".  
   - Grammarly suggested changes to wording and corrected spelling. Changes were not always accepted.  
   - Grammarly was chosen to ensure consistent word choice throughout.

2. **Google summaries**
   - Primarily used for finding relevant case studies and sources.  
   - Some summaries generated by searches were used as a basis for some of the written material.

3. **EndNote 2025‑1** (<https://endnote.com/>)
   - EndNote was used to create the bibliography.  
   - EndNote was used to create in‑text citations.  
   - EndNote was chosen to ensure that APA style was used both in the in‑text citations and the bibliography. The APA style, which EndNote provides, has been modified to include features such as line numbers.

4. **Lumo AI chatbot from Proton**
   - Lumo was used to evaluate this writing and to suggest possible corrections (this was done prior to making changes).  
     - Link to conversation: <https://lumo.proton.me/u/5/c/d483b174-4cac-41ac-be92-90d25b790426>  
     - Prompt used: “evaluate the word document based on the rubric.” Both the policy document and the rubric were uploaded to the Lumo chatbot.  
     - Full conversation: *Appendix II* (see below).

5. **The Comet Assistant search engine** from Perplexity was used to search for sources.

6. **Writefull** (<https://www.writefull.com/>) – free version was used to correct some word choices.

> The various AI tools were used to identify different sources and case studies, including summaries and searches, to support the existing content and multiple ideas I presented through searches. These tools also helped in annotating this document with EndNote and checking spelling and grammar throughout using Grammarly and Writefull. Although I could have completed this paper without AI, using AI made it easier to locate and identify the resources and relevant case studies I would have eventually found. Grammarly’s error checking also made writing much simpler.
