## Appendix VI – Sample Policies 

*(Based on publicly available university AI‑policy examples)*

### 1. Prohibiting Generative AI Use in Your Course (AI‑FREE)  
**Source:** Cornell University – Academic Integrity (2025) – <https://teaching.cornell.edu/generative-artificial-intelligence/ai-academic-integrity>

> “To ensure development and mastery of the foundational concepts and skills in this course, the use of generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools is prohibited. This includes tools that help reorganize and edit your written work because the ability to self‑assess, reflect on your writing process, and develop your own voice are essential in your growth as a writer. If you are unsure of any policy or any assignment‑specific directions—including whether or not a tool is considered generative AI—please consult with me prior to using the technology or completing your assignment. You are responsible for verifying the accuracy of citations and references used in your writing. You will be asked to verbally explain your research and writing process during in‑class discussions and in a one‑on‑one meeting with me. In acknowledgment that AI is impacting our field, please know that appropriate and ethical use of generative AI tools will likely be a part of other courses in your academic program.”

### 2. Permitting Generative AI Use with Attribution (AS‑UA)  
**Source:** Cornell University – Academic Integrity (2025) – <https://teaching.cornell.edu/generative-artificial-intelligence/ai-academic-integrity>

> “Mastering the essential, foundational concepts of this course takes effort and practice. Accordingly, the use of generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools is generally discouraged in this course, but will be permitted for select assignments. Whether or not generative AI assistance is permitted for each assignment will be explicitly communicated when that assignment is introduced.  
> If used in any capacity for an assignment, generative AI requires proper attribution for any and all generated work. As AI‑generated materials are not retrievable by graders—and there is not a person to whom the work can be attributed—students should attribute directly quoted text to the creator of the generative AI tool used (e.g., cite OpenAI when directly quoting ChatGPT). This attribution should be used for both in‑text citations and your reference list.”

> **Example citation:**  
> “When prompted with, ‘Is it ethical to use generative AI without proper attribution?’ ChatGPT indicated, ‘Using generative AI without proper attribution can be considered ethically problematic, as it raises issues related to intellectual property, transparency, and honesty’ (OpenAI, 2023).”

### 3. Encouraging Generative AI Use with Attribution (ANY‑AI‑UA)  
**Source:** Cornell University – Academic Integrity (2025) – <https://teaching.cornell.edu/generative-artificial-intelligence/ai-academic-integrity>

> “The use of generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools is encouraged on identified assignments. The directions for each assignment in this course will clearly indicate whether or not the use of generative AI is permitted for that assignment.  
> If used at all, generative AI requires proper attribution for any generated work. As AI‑generated materials are not retrievable by graders—and there is not a person to whom the work can be attributed—students should attribute directly quoted text to the creator of the generative AI tool used (e.g., cite OpenAI when directly quoting ChatGPT). This attribution should be used for both in‑text citations and your reference list.”

### 4. Permitting Generative AI Use on an Assignment‑by‑Assignment Basis (AS)  
**Source:** Cornell University – Academic Integrity (2025) – <https://teaching.cornell.edu/generative-artificial-intelligence/ai-course-policy-icons>

> “Policies concerning the use of generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools will be decided on an assignment‑by‑assignment basis. These policies will be clearly communicated alongside other details of each specific assignment.  
> As generative AI technologies evolve, class policies with respect to the use of generative AI tools may be shaped by in‑class discussions regarding the fair use of AI and its implications on careers in this field.  
> Regardless of whether or not the use of generative AI is permitted or prohibited for an assignment, it is critical that you adhere to our communicated course policy (and Cornell’s policy) on academic integrity. If you are unsure of any policy or any assignment‑specific directions—including whether or not a tool is considered AI—please consult the instructor prior to using the technology or completing your assignment.”
