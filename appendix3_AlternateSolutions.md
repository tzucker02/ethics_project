## Appendix III – Alternate Solutions

### Technical Solutions

1. **Bias‑Reduced AI Detector (Pangram Labs)**  
   - Aim: Identify AI‑generated text while minimizing false positives for ESL students.  
   - Quote (Jiang et al., 2024): “research investigating these detectors' fairness and potential bias is relatively rare...”  
   - **Cost:** $5 /student / year.

2. **GPTZero Enhanced Model**  
   - Claims to have re‑run the Stanford experiment on its new product with markedly better results (Tian, 2023).  
   - **Cost:** Free for life.

### Assignment‑Design Toolkits (Already Available)

- **MIT Sloan – Designing AI‑Resistant Assignments**  
  - URL: <https://mitsloanedtech.mit.edu/ai/teach/ai-detectors-dont-work/> (2024)  
  - Provides templates for prompts that require personal reflection, local data, or multiple drafts, making pure AI generation impractical.

- **Carnegie Mellon – Generative AI FAQ for Instructors**  
  - URL: <https://www.cmu.edu/teaching/technology/aitools/index.html> (2024)  
  - Offers a decision tree on when to use a detector, when to rely on draft histories, and how to communicate expectations to students.

These alternatives can be combined with the policy framework to give institutions a multi‑layered approach: a **technical guardrail**, **faculty training**, and **assignment redesign** that together reduce reliance on imperfect AI detectors.
