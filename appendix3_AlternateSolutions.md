## Appendix III – Alternate Solutions

> **Technical Solutions**

1. **Develop a bias‑reduced AI‑detector**  
   - Need a method for identifying AI‑generated text while minimizing false positives among ESL students.  
   - According to the Pangram Labs study, “research investigating these detectors' fairness and potential bias is relatively rare…” (Jiang et al., 2024).  
   - **Cost:** $5.00 /student / year.

2. **GPTZero improvements**  
   - Claims to have re‑run the Stanford experiment on its new product with much better results (Tian, 2023).  
   - **Cost:** Free for life.

> **Assignment‑design toolkits** (already available)

- **MIT Sloan** – “[Designing AI‑Resistant Assignments](https://mitsloanedtech.mit.edu/ai/teach/ai-detectors-dont-work/)” (2024) – templates for prompts that require personal reflection, local data, or multiple drafts, making pure AI generation infeasible.  

- **Carnegie Mellon** – “[Generative AI FAQ for Instructors](https://www.cmu.edu/teaching/technology/aitools/index.html)” (2024) – decision tree on when to use a detector, when to rely on draft histories, and how to communicate expectations to students.
