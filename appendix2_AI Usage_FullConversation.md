# Appendix II – AI Usage – full conversation

Below each rubric section I've noted how the paper performs, assigned the appropriate point band, and offered concrete suggestions for improvement. Scores are summed at the end for the final percentage.

1️⃣ **Problem Identification & Ethical Context (30 pts)**  

   -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
   **Observation**                                        **Rating**  
   ------------------------------------------------------ ----------------------------  
   **Clarity of the ethical issue** -- The introduction   **Exemplary** (15 pts)  
   clearly states that AI‑detectors pose bias,       
   fairness, and civil‑rights problems for                
   English‑Language‑Learner (ELL) students. The link to   
   Title IV and the AI‑Bill of Rights is explicit.        

   **Depth of research** -- The paper cites > 30         **Proficient** (11‑13 pts)  
   sources, including recent studies (Furze 2024,         
   Mathewson 2023, Stanford study, OCR memo 2025). The    
   literature review, however, sometimes reads as a          
   catalog of citations rather than a tightly argued      
   problem statement.                                     

   **Ethical framing** -- Both deontological (duty to     
   treat students equally) and consequentialist (harm     
   from false positives) perspectives are discussed,      
   showing good ethical breadth.                          
   -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------  

   **Score:** 13 pts (solid problem definition with room to tighten the narrative).
